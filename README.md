# Agent-Based-Model-C++

We developed an agent-based model (ABM) composed of a collection of autonomous decision-making individuals following a set of rules. Agents are embedded in a two-dimensional grid where we set a spatial distribution of water. The principal difference between the C++ and GPU codes is the synchronization presented at the frequency of discarding in the first one.
